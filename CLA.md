# ChainGraph Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for contributing to ChainGraph! Before we can accept your contributions, you need to agree to the following
terms:

1. **Ownership**
    - You retain ownership of your contributions. However, by submitting a contribution, you grant BadLabs a perpetual,
      worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense your contributions.

2. **Rights & Warranties**
    - You confirm that you have the legal right to contribute this code. In particular, you confirm that your
      contribution does not contain code that is derived from a project under an incompatible license (e.g., GPL), or
      code that is owned by an entity that has not authorized you to contribute it.
    - Your contribution does not violate any third-party rights (e.g., patents, copyrights).

3. **Future License Changes**
    - You acknowledge that the project may be re-licensed under a different license, whether open source or proprietary.

4. **License Header Requirement**
    - All source code contributions must include the standard project license header at the top of each file.
    - If your contribution is missing a license header, maintainers may ask you to add it before accepting your
      contribution.

   The standard project license header is as follows.
   Replace `[year]` with the actual year of your contribution (without brackets):

   ```typescript
   /*
   * Copyright (c) [year] BadLabs
   *
   * Use of this software is governed by the Business Source License 1.1 included in the file LICENSE.txt.
   *
   * As of the Change Date specified in that file, in accordance with the Business Source License, use of this software will be governed by the Apache License, version 2.0.
   */
   ```

By submitting a contribution (e.g., a pull request), you agree to this CLA. If you do not agree, do not contribute.
