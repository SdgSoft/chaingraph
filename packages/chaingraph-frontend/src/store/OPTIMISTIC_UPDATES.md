# WIP Proposal: Universal Optimistic Updates System for Effector-Based Frontend Applications

## Abstract

This proposal outlines a universal system for handling optimistic updates in frontend applications that use the Effector state management library. The system is designed to improve user experience by providing immediate feedback in the UI while ensuring consistency with the server state. Key features include support for temporary identifiers (IDs), rollback mechanisms, and extensibility for various data entities like nodes, edges, and UI elements. The goal is to develop this system into an open-source Effector library that can benefit the wider development community.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

In interactive frontend applications, especially real-time collaborative tools, users expect immediate feedback when they perform actions. Network latency and server processing times can delay updates, leading to a perception of sluggishness or unresponsiveness in the application. Optimistic updates address this by updating the UI immediately, assuming the server will accept the change. However, implementing optimistic updates can be complex, especially when dealing with failures, conflicts, and temporary identifiers.

### 1.2 Current Limitations

Current implementations often handle optimistic updates on a case-by-case basis, leading to duplicated logic, inconsistent behaviors, and difficulty in maintaining the codebase. Additionally, features like handling temporary IDs for new entities and ensuring rollback on failure complicate the implementation, making it error-prone and harder to extend or reuse in other projects.

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

### 2.1 Overview

We propose a universal, reusable system for implementing optimistic updates in Effector-based applications. This system abstracts the complexity of managing optimistic state changes, rollbacks, temporary IDs, and synchronization with the server. It provides a consistent interface for declaring optimistic operations, making it easier to maintain, extend, and potentially share as an open-source library.

### 2.2 Core Concepts

#### 2.2.1 Optimistic Update Object

An `OptimisticUpdate` object represents an in-flight optimistic change. It contains all the necessary information to apply the change, track its status, and roll it back if needed. By standardizing the structure of these updates, we can manage them uniformly across different parts of the application.

**Fields:**

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the update, often a UUID.
- **`type`**: A descriptive string indicating the type of update (e.g., `'node/add'`, `'edge/remove'`).
- **`payload`**: The data associated with the update, such as the new state or the parameters of the action.
- **`tempId`**: Optional temporary identifier used when creating new entities before receiving a server-generated ID.
- **`previousState`**: The state before the update was applied, used for rollback.
- **`timestamp`**: The time the update was created.
- **`status`**: The current status of the update (`'pending'`, `'completed'`, `'failed'`).
- **`apply`**: Function to apply the update to the current state (`(state: T) => T`).
- **`rollback`**: Function to revert the state in case of failure (`(state: T) => T`).

#### 2.2.2 Update Store

A centralized store (`$optimisticUpdates`) maintains all optimistic updates, allowing the application to track pending operations and handle them uniformly. This store can be observed to provide UI feedback about ongoing operations.

#### 2.2.3 Operation Factory

A factory function, `createOptimisticOperation`, simplifies the creation of optimistic operations. It encapsulates the logic for applying updates, handling server responses, managing temporary IDs, and performing rollbacks. This promotes code reuse and consistency.

### 2.3 Handling Temporary Identifiers

#### 2.3.1 Temporary IDs Generation

When a new entity is created optimistically (e.g., adding a new node), a temporary ID is generated on the client side using a method like `uuidv4()` to ensure uniqueness within the client's scope. This ID is used in the UI and the application state to reference the entity until the server returns the real ID.

#### 2.3.2 ID Replacement Mechanism

Upon receiving a server response, the system replaces the temporary ID with the real server-generated ID throughout the application's state. This involves updating the entity itself and any other entities that reference it (e.g., edges that connect to the new node). The update store tracks which optimistic updates are associated with which temporary IDs, facilitating this replacement process seamlessly.

### 2.4 Conflict Resolution and Rollback

If the server rejects an optimistic update (e.g., due to validation errors or conflicts), the system must revert the local changes to maintain consistency. The rollback function defined in the `OptimisticUpdate` object handles this by restoring the previous state.

For conflicts that can be resolved on the client side, the system can provide hooks to implement custom conflict resolution strategies. This might involve merging changes or prompting the user to make a decision.

### 2.5 Open-Source Library Features

The aim is to package this system as an open-source Effector library. Key features include:

- **Universal Optimistic Update Handling**: A consistent and reusable approach to manage optimistic updates across various entities.
- **Temporary ID Management**: Built-in support for generating and replacing temporary IDs, crucial for entities created optimistically.
- **Automatic Rollbacks**: Simplified rollback mechanisms when updates fail, reducing the need for manual error handling.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to define custom optimistic operations for different entities and actions.
- **Status Tracking**: Tracking of optimistic updates' statuses, enabling UI components to reflect synchronization states (e.g., loading indicators, error messages).
- **Conflict Resolution Hooks**: Ability to define custom strategies for resolving conflicts when server data differs from optimistic local changes.
- **Batch Updates Support**: Grouping multiple optimistic updates to minimize server requests and handle dependencies between updates.
- **Full TypeScript Support**: Leveraging TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Middleware and Plugin Support**: Allowing integration of additional functionalities such as logging, analytics, or error reporting.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Optimistic Update Object

The `OptimisticUpdate` object serves as the core data structure for managing optimistic operations. Its standardized format enables the system to handle diverse types of updates uniformly.

**Example:**

```typescript
interface OptimisticUpdate<T, P = any> {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  payload: P;
  tempId?: string;
  previousState: T;
  timestamp: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  apply: (state: T) => T;
  rollback: (state: T) => T;
}
```

### 3.2 Update Store

An Effector store, `$optimisticUpdates`, holds the current optimistic updates. It can be used to derive other stores, such as `$pendingUpdates`, which filters updates with the `'pending'` status.

**Example:**

```typescript
const $optimisticUpdates = createStore<Map<string, OptimisticUpdate<any>>>(new Map());

const $pendingUpdates = $optimisticUpdates.map(updates => 
  new Map(Array.from(updates.entries())
    .filter(([_, update]) => update.status === 'pending'))
);
```

### 3.3 Operation Factory

The `createOptimisticOperation` factory function simplifies the creation of new optimistic operations. It takes configuration parameters and returns a set of events (`start`, `success`, `fail`) to manage the operation's lifecycle.

#### 3.3.1 Configuration Parameters

- **`type`**: A string representing the update type.
- **`store`**: The Effector store that the operation will modify.
- **`apply`**: Function to apply the optimistic update to the state.
- **`rollback`**: Function to revert the state if the update fails.
- **`effect`**: Effector effect that represents the server-side operation.
- **`onServerResponse`**: Optional function to handle successful server responses (e.g., replacing temporary IDs).
- **`onFailure`**: Optional function to handle failures beyond rollback (e.g., displaying error messages).

#### 3.3.2 Example Usage for Node Addition

```typescript
const addNodeOperation = createOptimisticOperation<NodeState, AddNodeEvent>({
  type: 'node/add',
  store: $nodes,
  apply: (state, payload) => {
    const tempId = generateTemporaryId();
    const node: NodeState = {
      id: tempId,
      ...payload,
      metadata: {
        ...payload.metadata,
        id: tempId,
      },
    };
    return { ...state, [tempId]: node };
  },
  rollback: (state, payload, tempId) => {
    const { [tempId]: _, ...rest } = state;
    return rest;
  },
  effect: addNodeToFlowFx,
  onServerResponse: (response, tempId) => {
    // Replace tempId with real ID in state and related entities
    replaceTemporaryId(tempId, response.realId);
  },
});
```

### 3.4 Temporary IDs Implementation

Temporary IDs are critical for entities created optimistically before the server assigns a real identifier. The system tracks these temporary IDs and provides a mechanism to replace them upon receiving the server's response.

**Steps:**

1. **Generate a Temporary ID:** Use a UUID generator to create a unique temporary ID.
2. **Use the Temporary ID in the State and UI:** Reference the new entity using the temporary ID.
3. **Send the Temporary ID to the Server:** Include the temporary ID in the request payload, allowing the server to send back a mapping.
4. **Replace Temporary ID upon Response:** Update the state by replacing the temporary ID with the real ID provided by the server.

### 3.5 Conflict Resolution Strategies

Optimistic updates can lead to conflicts when the server state differs from the expected state. The library can provide hooks for custom conflict resolution strategies.

**Possible Strategies:**

- **Automatic Retry:** Attempt to reapply the update after fetching the latest state.
- **User Intervention:** Notify the user of the conflict and provide options for resolution.
- **Merge Changes:** If applicable, merge the optimistic changes with the server state.

### 3.6 Batch Updates

Batching multiple optimistic updates can optimize network usage and handle dependencies between updates. The library can handle batching transparently, grouping updates within a certain time frame or based on application logic.

### 3.7 Status Tracking and UI Integration

By tracking the status of optimistic updates, the application can provide feedback to the user, such as:

- **Loading Indicators:** Showing spinners or progress bars for pending operations.
- **Success Notifications:** Informing the user when operations complete successfully.
- **Error Messages:** Displaying errors when operations fail, along with options to retry or undo.

### 5.3 Timeouts and Retries

The system can support timeouts for pending updates, triggering retries or alternative actions if the server does not respond within a certain timeframe.

### 5.4 Prioritization of Updates

Allowing updates to have priority levels ensures that critical updates are processed promptly, while less critical ones can be deferred or batched.

### 5.5 Integration with Server Push Technologies

Supporting technologies like WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) enables the application to receive real-time updates from the server, helping to keep the client state in sync and resolve conflicts more effectively.

### 5.6 Support for Complex Data Structures

The system can be extended to handle complex data structures, such as nested entities or graphs, ensuring that optimistic updates and rollbacks correctly manage deeply nested state.

### 5.7 Comprehensive TypeScript Definitions

Providing robust TypeScript definitions and interfaces ensures type safety and improves developer experience, reducing the likelihood of bugs.

## 6. Challenges and Considerations

While the proposed system offers many benefits, there are challenges to consider:

- **State Consistency:** Ensuring that the state remains consistent during rapid updates or in the presence of errors.
- **Performance Overhead:** Managing additional state and tracking can introduce performance overhead; optimizations may be necessary.
- **Complexity for Developers:** Abstracting complexity is beneficial, but the underlying mechanisms must be well-documented to avoid confusion.
- **Dependency Management:** The library should minimize external dependencies or manage them carefully to remain lightweight and compatible.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Implementing a universal optimistic updates system provides significant benefits in terms of user experience, code maintainability, and application reliability. By abstracting the complexities of optimistic updates into a reusable library, developers can focus on building features rather than handling repetitive state management tasks.

Key features like temporary IDs and rollback mechanisms address common challenges and lay the foundation for a robust solution that can be shared with the open-source community. By fostering collaboration and adopting best practices, this system can improve the development process for real-time, interactive applications.
